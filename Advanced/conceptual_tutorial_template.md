<!-- Some examples of how to mark up various things

This is _italics_ and this is **bold**.

Only use italics and bold for specific things. Learn more at https://do.co/style#bold-and-italics

This is `inline code`. Use it for referencing package names and commands.

Here's a command someone types in the Terminal:

```command
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```

Here's a configuration file. The label on the first line lets you clearly state the file that's being shown or modified:

```nginx
[label /etc/nginx/sites-available/default]
server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    listen [::]:80 default_server ipv6only=on;

    root <^>/usr/share/nginx/html<^>;
    index index.html index.htm;

    server_name localhost;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

Here's output from a command:

```
[secondary_label Output]
Could not connect to Redis at 127.0.0.1:6379: Connection refused
```
