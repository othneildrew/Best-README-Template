## About The Project

![Xidipity GitHub Readme Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WpThemeDev/Best-README-Template/v1.0.0/images/p_readme_960x720_1.png)

The goal of Xidipity is to create a high quality WordPress theme with the following characteristics.
1. satisfying to use
2. versatile in the creation of content

### Satisfying To Use

The first requirement is the theme must display well on a variety of devices. This is known as responsive. Xidipity is designed to ensure a good user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

The second requirement is readability. Xidipity uses industry standard Google fonts. The base font family is Roboto matched with Roboto Slab as an alternative for headers.

The third requirement is pleasing esthetics. This is satisfied by the use of appropriately selected and matched colors. The design leverages a palette of base, primary, and secondary hues matched using tools from Adobe.

The last requirement is performance. This is satisfied by using the latest in web technologies.

### Versatile in the Creation of Content

Xidipity uses an enhanced version of the classic editor.
