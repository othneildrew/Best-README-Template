<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Xidipity is a high quality WordPress theme with the following characteristics.
1. satisfying to use
2. versatile in the creation of content

### Satisfying To Use

The first requirement is the theme must display well on a variety of devices. This is known as responsive. Xidipity is designed to ensure a satisfying user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

The second requirement is readability. Xidipity uses industry standard Google fonts. Much of the text is styed with the font family Roboto with the paragraph headers h1-h4 styled with Roboto Slab. Kaushan script is used to style the blog title.

The third requirement is pleasing esthetics. This is satisfied by the use of appropriately selected and matched colors. The design leverages a palette of base, primary, and secondary hues matched using tools from Adobe.

The last requirement is performance. This is satisfied by using the latest in web technologies. Much of the theme's design leverages the W3C Flexible Box Module (flexbox) and to further boost performance, it is suggested a plugin like Native Lazyload by Google be installed to reduce image load times.
